    "Insulator genomic function refers either to a barrier function or an enhancer-blocking function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Barrier function. In cellular division heterochromatin and euchromatin must to be insulated from each other to prevent undesirable gene expression, for instance to prevent the inactive heterochromatic domain from erroneously inhibiting genes in the active euchromatic domain and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Enhancer-blockig function. The activity of a given gene is controlled by enhancer sequences, which can be found either adjacent to the gene promoter or at a considerable distance either downstream or upstream of the gene. Distance at the level of the linear genome does not impose a problem for enhancer function as the intervening DNA is looped out such that promoter and enhancer will be in close contact. Insulators play a role in the three-dimensional folding of chromatin, allowing for or preventing functional contact between enhancer and promoter elements.\n",

    "*DNASE I*\n",
    "\n",
    "Deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I), is an endonuclease coded by the human gene DNASE1.\n",

Exciting recent work has demonstrated roles for CTCF in, for example, embryonic, neuronal and haematopoietic development. \n",
    "\n",
    "Its main roles are:\n",

    "1. Insulation by binding of targeting insulator sequence elements located between enhancer and promoter sequences, blocking the interaction of transcription factors.\n",
